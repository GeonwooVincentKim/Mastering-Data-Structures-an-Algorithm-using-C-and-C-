Introduction
- 1. Languages
  = C, C++, Java, C#, Python, JS, ...

- 2. Topics
  = 1. List of Data Structures (= Physical Data Structure)
    -> 1. Arrays, Matrics, Linked List
    -> 2. Define how the data is arranged in the memory (arrangement)
    -> 3. Ex) int a[10]; int b[5][5];

  = 2. Logical Data Structure
    -> 1. Stack, Queue, Trees, Graph, Hashing
    -> 2. Define how the data can be utilized, how the arrangement should be utilized (utilization)

  = Arrays, Matrics, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graph, Hashing, Recursion, Sortings

- 3. Memory and CPU
  = 1. CPU
  = 2. Memory
    -> 1. Data
       => Data Structure 
	  -- 1. Best utilized by the program, efficiently utilized by the program
	  -- 2. Arrangement of data

    -> 2. Program Code
       => Perform operations on the data
